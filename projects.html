<h1> <em> Systems Analysis and Design </em> <h1>
<p> Note: This is project is still currently a work in progress. </p>

<p> The following group project is a semester long group project for my Systems Analysis and Design class and goes through each phase of the systems development life cycle. The main objective is to take an open for interpretation case study based off a bicycle company and we are required to implement techniques from the systems development lifecycle. Our submissions were broken down into phases and were presented to our class.</p>
<p> For this project, some of the portions that I was mostly responsible for included conducting an economic feasibility report in Excel to calculate return on investment, cost-benefit analysis, break-even point, and net present value of the proposed system.</p>
<p>In the analysis phase, I was responsible for constructing the data flow diagrams and the entity relationship diagram for the proposed system.</p>
<p> In the design phase, I was responsible for creating the alternative matrix and worked on the design specifications. </p>

<h1> <em> PC Builds </em> </h1>
<p> As a computer building enthuisiast, I like keeping up with new hardware and offering help to others looking to break into PC building and PC gaming. Besides knowledge of building the systems, this hobby has helped me to reinforce the concepts for the A+ certification I'm currently studying for such as how to configure the systems, and troubleshoot errors.
 the systems. </p>
 <p>Here are some of the builds that I've worked on for the past three years. When recommending what parts to buy, I always consider the potential use cases, budget, and special conditions to try and create something with the most value.I've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work with different types of hardware and varying form factors. </p>
